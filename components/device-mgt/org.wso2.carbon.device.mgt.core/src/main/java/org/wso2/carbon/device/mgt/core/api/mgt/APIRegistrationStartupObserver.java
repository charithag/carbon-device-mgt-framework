 * Note: Using this particular approach is not a must, had there been a proper programming interface provided by the
 * underlying API-Management infrastructure for manipulating the APIs. Even though, there's one, its concrete
 * implementation consumes a set of OSGi declarative services for initializing some of its internal states, which
 * prevents us from, simply, instantiating the APIPublisher implementation and using for device management related
 * tasks. The aforesaid complication lead us to go for this alternative approach to get the same done.
